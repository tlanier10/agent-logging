# agent-logging
This project involves building an efficient and secure log aggregation system that collects logs from multiple servers and sends them to a remote Elasticsearch server. The core components include a Python-based log agent that reads log files and batches, compresses them, and securely transmits data to Elasticsearch using TLS encryption. The system is designed to handle large-scale deployments with thousands of servers, requiring careful attention to performance optimization, efficient indexing, and scalability. The project also includes setting up secure communication channels through CA-signed certificates and leveraging tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or Ansible for deployment automation.

The project's primary goals are to ensure efficient log processing, secure transmission, and scalability, making it suitable for distributed systems in production environments. It provides valuable experience with Elasticsearch, containerization, secure communications, and deployment strategies, making it highly relevant for resumes in system administration, DevOps, and software engineering roles. With a part-time commitment of around 4 hours per week, the project will take approximately 6-7 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the setup and testing phases.
